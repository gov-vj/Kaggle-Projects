* [Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/gov-vj/Kaggle-Projects/blob/master/Titanic%20Machine%20Learning%20from%20Disaster%20v2.0.ipynb) [(Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) [(nbviewer)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gov-vj/Kaggle-Projects/blob/master/Titanic%20Machine%20Learning%20from%20Disaster%20v2.0.ipynb) - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on Kaggle. Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.
* [DonorsChoose.org Application Screening](https://github.com/gov-vj/Kaggle-Projects/blob/master/DonorsChoose.org%20Application%20Screening.ipynb) [(Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/donorschoose-application-screening) [(nbviewer)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gov-vj/Kaggle-Projects/blob/master/DonorsChoose.org%20Application%20Screening.ipynb) - DonorsChoose.org empowers public school teachers from across the country to request much-needed materials and experiences for their students. DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. This is a competition on Kaggle where people can create a machine learning model to help this fund with auto-approving of applications.

Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn](https://github.com/gov-vj/Kaggle-Projects/blob/master/Bag%20of%20Words%20Meets%20Bags%20of%20Popcorn.ipynb) [(Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial) [(nbviewer)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial) - Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn is a sentimental analysis problem. Based on texts of reviews we predict whether they are positive or negative. General description and data are available on Kaggle. The data provided consists of raw reviews and class (1 or 2), so the main part is cleaning the texts.
* [Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!](https://github.com/gov-vj/Kaggle-Projects/blob/master/Ghouls%2C%20Goblins%2C%20and%20Ghosts...%20Boo!.ipynb) [(Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo) [(nbviewer)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gov-vj/Kaggle-Projects/blob/master/Ghouls%2C%20Goblins%2C%20and%20Ghosts...%20Boo%21.ipynb) - Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo! is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem: based on information about monsters we predict their types. A fun competition for Halloween. General description and data are available on Kaggle. This dataset has little number of samples, so careful feature selection and model ensemble are necessary for high accuracy.
